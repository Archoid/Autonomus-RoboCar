## 1. Objective
To design a Single buggy capable of following main track twice in an clockwise direction under full supervisory control. Buggy must be capable of detecting an obstacle whilst following the track, coming to a halt if it does. The buggy must safely park in the parking bay. It prints the state of the track and buggy at each gantry stop. No external end-
user manual control input is permitted once the initial start is signalled.
